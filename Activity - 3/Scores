Prompt 
Please review my Arduino code for a fire sensor simulation using a thermistor and photoresistor. The LED and buzzer do not activate when the temperature increases. Can you help identify the issue?
My thermistor has three pins. Can you explain how I should properly connect it to the Arduino?
Ive uploaded an image of my current sensor module and circuit. Could you confirm if my wiring setup is correct
Whats wrong with my code?
The LED and buzzer are functioning correctly when tested separately, but they do not respond to sensor readings. Can you help me identify what’s missing in my circuit or code?
The circuit works but does not react to fire simulation as expected. Can you walk me through a step-by-step method to verify sensor readings and adjust threshold limits?
